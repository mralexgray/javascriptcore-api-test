Experiments with the new Objective-C API for JavaScriptCore

See the accompanying [blog post](http://www.steamclock.com/blog/2013/05/apple-objective-c-javascript-bridge/) for more details.

A newer demo project is now available, which we presented at JSConf EU 2013: https://github.com/steamclock/jscalc. The JSCalc demo is cross-plafrorm on iOS 7 and Android.
